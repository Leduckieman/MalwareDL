# Disclaimer
This application uses parts of the example script by MalwareBazaar, found (here)[https://github.com/cocaman/malware-bazaar/blob/master/bazaar_download.py].\
You can freely use this application, as long as, if you're using, say for a youtube video, you should link this GitHub page in the description\
That's all I'm asking, but MalwareBazaar is different. They have their own ToS, listed (here)[https://bazaar.abuse.ch/faq/#tos]. In short:\
• Don't use this maliciously\
• Me and MB aren't responsible for damage\
• Data is served *as is*, meaning no warranty whatsoever.\
• You can use this as much as you want, all I ask for is for you to link it somewhere. MB, on the other hand, doesn't ask for anything.\
